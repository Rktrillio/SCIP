;Data abstractions for analysing twitter moods.
;Since we have already extracted the file containing the data to the local machine
;we shall use data science to process the information
;and plot to visualize the results

(require data-science-master)
(require plot)
(require math)
;(require json)

;procedure to read the raw data from the json file in racket
;file is stored on the device.
(define extracts (open-input-file "project1.json"))

;extracts


;Then clean the data by removing punctions, urls, spaces and unneccessary capitalization
;from each tweet
(define extracts-text (string-normalize-spaces
		   (remove-punctuation
                    (remove-urls
                     (string-downcase (port->string extracts))))))

;extracts-text
(close-input-port extracts)

;Procedure to sort the words in the document created above.
;Here we look for unique words and the number of times they appear.
(define twords (document->tokens extracts-text #:sort? #t))

;twords

;Procedure to assign or mark each word with an emotional label
;using the nrc lexicon
(define sentiment (list->sentiment twords #:lexicon 'nrc))


;Words in above maybe assigned the same sentiment label, 
;so we aggregrate (by summing) across the tokens to give us a
;better analysis of how many words have the simlar sentiment.
(aggregate sum ($ sentiment 'sentiment) ($ sentiment 'freq))


;Using a discrete-histogram we can plot the number of times a given sentiment
;appeared against the sentiment itself.
 
(let ([counts (aggregate sum ($ sentiment 'sentiment) ($ sentiment 'freq))])
  (parameterize ((plot-width 800))
    (plot (list
	   (tick-grid)
	   (discrete-histogram
	    (sort counts (Î» (x y) (> (second x) (second y))))
	    #:color "OrangeRed"
	    #:line-color "DimGray"))
	  #:x-label "Affective Label"
	  #:y-label "Frequency")))
